 abstract = {We consider multiphysics applications from algorithmic and
architectural perspectives, where ``algorithmic'' includes both
mathematical analysis and computational complexity and
``architectural'' includes both software and hardware environments.
Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to
their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling
paradigm. Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form
is not always practical for realistic applications, but model problems
representative of applications discussed herein can provide insight.
A variety of software frameworks for multiphysics applications have
been constructed and refined within disciplinary communities and
executed on leading-edge computer systems.  We examine several of
these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to
extrapolate best practices to future systems. From our study, we
summarize challenges and forecast opportunities.}
