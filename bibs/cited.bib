abstract = {The software development community widely acknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design. Through domain models, software developers are able to express rich functionality and translate it into a software implementation that truly serves the need of its users. But despite its obvious importance, there are few practical resources that explain how to incorporate effective domain modeling into the software development process. This book fills that need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development.},
